# 0x01. Basic Authentication

## Back-end | Authentication

## Background Context

In this project, we will learn about the authentication process and implement **Basic Authentication** on a simple API.

> **Note:** In real-world scenarios, it's recommended to use established modules or frameworks to implement authentication (e.g., `Flask-HTTPAuth` in Python). However, this project focuses on learning by building the mechanism step-by-step.
